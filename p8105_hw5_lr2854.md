The raw data includes 52179 observations of 12 variables for homicides
in the 50 largest US cities (by population in 2012). Each record
includes information about the victim, the date of the report, the
location of the homicide, and the disposition of the case (whether an
arrest was made). The named variables are uid, reported_date,
victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex, city,
state, lat, lon, disposition, city_state. More information about the
data is available from the original data source,
[here](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides).

``` r
bmore_prop_test = prop.test(subset(unsolved, city_state == "Baltimore, MD")$n_unsolved,
          subset(unsolved, city_state == "Baltimore, MD")$total_homicides) %>%
  broom::tidy()

pull(bmore_prop_test, estimate)
##         p 
## 0.6455607
pull(bmore_prop_test, conf.low)
## [1] 0.6275625
pull(bmore_prop_test, conf.high)
## [1] 0.6631599
```

For the city of Baltimore, MD, the estimated proportion is 0.646 (95%
confidence interval \[0.628, 0.663\])

For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the prop.test function to estimate
the proportion of homicides that are unsolved; save the output of
prop.test as an R object, apply the broom::tidy to this object and pull
the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting
tidy dataframe.

Now run prop.test for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract
both the proportion of unsolved homicides and the confidence interval
for each. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of purrr::map,
purrr::map2, list columns and unnest as necessary to create a tidy
dataframe with estimated proportions and CIs for each city.

Create a plot that shows the estimates and CIs for each city – check out
geom_errorbar for a way to add error bars based on the upper and lower
limits. Organize cities according to the proportion of unsolved
homicides.
